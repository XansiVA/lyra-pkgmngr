currently only 
`lyra -i` works at best.
however. you must type -i for installing and does extract, install and all packages with tar.gz on github work that i've seen this works with 
./lyra -i ripgrep https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/14.1.0/ripgrep-14.1.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz

for ripgrep the name ripgrep just outputs the name of the package after its installed which you can check version with.
